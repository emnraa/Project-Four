        <h2>Research and Idea Development</h2>
        <p>
          Ideas always come from a source of inspiration. Good designs come from
          conducting research, much like the start of any other project.
          Designers gather information, aesthetics, inspiration and often
          combine them to make mood boards as a visual representation. Once an
          idea starts to form, this is when we start sketching it out.

        <h2>Sketching and Design Concept</h2>

        <p>
          While sketching the piece, a designer needs to take into account
          several factors for when the piece actually becomes tangible. Things
          like color, structure, structure or texture are all things that are
          kept in mind. The final sketch is the framework of any piece.
        </p>

        <h3>Sketch Your Ideas!</h3>

        <h2>Making Patterns</h2>
        <p>
          In fashion design, patterns are essentially the templates used before
          assembling a final piece. It is similar to making a gingerbread house-
          all of the pieces start flat, but are arranged together to create a 3D
          model. They are traced onto fabric to be cut and assembled to form the
          basis of a toile.
        </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column">
            <img src="./images/Shirt Template.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <img src="./images/Template1.png" alt="" />
          </div>
        </div>

      </section>

        <h2>The Fitting</h2>
        <p>
          A toile is then made from the patterns, providing the basis of the
          completed product. There is lots of pinning, draping and adjusting
          involved so that when the final piece is made, it fits just right.

            id="dress"
            src="./images/Template-Dress.png"
            alt=""
          />
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Sewing the Final Fabric</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, the fabric that the designer had in mind is used to create
          their piece going off the basis of the toile, which provides the
          outline. This is when the garment starts coming alive with the colors,
          and texture that one would be able to see in the initial sketch. If
          adjustments were made in the toile, the same would be made in the new
          pattern.

        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Final Touches</h2>
        <p>
          Once the garment is made, the designer drapes the garment onto the
          model or onto a mannequin. They need to make sure it falls just as
          they wanted, and a critical eye is used to asses every little detail
          to perfection before it goes out onto the runway.
